# Laptop Price Predictor Web App
### Overview
The Laptop Price Predictor Web App is a Streamlit-based application that estimates the price of a laptop based on its specifications. By leveraging a machine learning model trained on historical laptop data, this app allows users to input various features and receive an estimated price for their desired laptop configuration.
